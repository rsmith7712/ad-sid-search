Run this script with sufficient permissions to resolve SIDs within your
Active Directory environment.


.HISTORY

2024-12-09:[UPDATES]v3.1
    Folder Creation:
        -Uses Test-Path to check if the C:\Temp folder exists
        -Creates the folder with New-Item if it doesn't exist
    Export Path:
        -Ensures the output CSV file is saved in C:\Temp
    User Feedback:
        -Notifies the user if the folder is created


2024-12-08:[UPDATES]v3
    Interactive Selection:
        -Prompts the user to select User, Computer, or Group
    Object Name Input:
        -Prompts the user to enter the name of the object to search for
    Automatic Formatting for Computer Names:
        -Appends $ to the object name if the selected type is Computer
    Search and Export:
        -Searches Active Directory for the object
        -Displays results in the console
        -Exports results to a CSV file (AD_Object_SIDs.csv)


2024-12-07:[UPDATES]v2.3
    Export to CSV:
        -Uses Export-Csv to save results to a file (AD_Object_SIDs.csv)
        -Each result is saved with SID, Account, and Domain columns
    Domain Parsing:
        -Extracts the domain information from the DistinguishedName
            property, splitting at DC= to build the full domain
    Conditional Export:
        -Only exports to CSV if results are found
    File Path:
        -Customize the $outputFile variable to specify the desired
            file location
    Output:
        -Console: Displays results in a formatted table
        -CSV File: A file named AD_Object_SIDs.csv with the following
            columns: SID | Account | Domain


2024-12-06:[UPDATES]v2.2
    Object Name with $:
        -If querying a computer account, append $ to the SamAccountName (CEO-LT01$)
    Object Type:
        -Ensure $objectType is set to "Computer" for computer accounts
        -User accounts typically have a SamAccountName without a trailing $
        -Computer accounts have a SamAccountName that ends with a $
    Result Check:
        -If the object isn't found, ensure the name and type match correctly

    Bug-Report:
    Error - WARNING: Valid values for attribute 'SamAccountName' should end with '$'; 
    the filter clause '(SamAccountName -eq CEO-LT01 )' may not work as intended.


2024-12-05:[UPDATES]v2.1
    Replace YourObjectName:
        -Replace YourObjectName with the actual name of the user, computer,
            or group you are searching for.
    Set the Object Type:
        -Change $objectType to "User", "Computer", or "Group" depending on
            what you're querying.
    Run the Script:
        -Execute the script in a PowerShell session with Active Directory
            module loaded and proper permissions.
    Explanation:
        -Active Directory Module: 
            The script uses the ActiveDirectory module, which provides
            cmdlets like Get-ADUser, Get-ADComputer, and Get-ADGroup.
        -SID Retrieval: 
            The SID property is explicitly fetched for the specified object.
        -Error Handling: 
            If the object isn't found or an invalid object type is specified,
            the script displays appropriate messages.


2024-12-04:[UPDATES]v2
    System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier:
        -This class is used to translate the SID directly into an NT Account
        -It's more reliable than Win32_SID in some environments
        -It's possible that the SIDs aren't resolvable through the Win32_SID class
    Error Handling:
        -If the SID cannot be translated, it captures the error and marks the entry as "Not Found."
    Domain and Account Separation:
        -The NT account is split into Domain and Account parts for better clarity
    How It Works:
        -Each SID is converted into a SecurityIdentifier object
        -The Translate method resolves the SID to an NT account
        -If resolution fails, "Not Found" is output for that SID
    
    Bug-Report:
    Error - Fails to return results. No account or domain information displayed


2024-12-03:[CREATED]v1
    List of SIDs:
        -The SIDs are stored in an array for iteration.
    WMI Query:
        -[wmi]"Win32_SID.SID='$sid'" resolves each SID to an AD object.
    Error Handling:
        -If the SID cannot be resolved, it outputs "Not Found."
    Results:
        -A custom object is created for each SID containing SID, AccountName, and ReferencedDomainName.
    Formatted Table:
        -The results are displayed in a neat table.

    Run this script in a PowerShell session with the appropriate permissions to access Active Directory.
